This is an attempt to create a calculator which calculates the electrical and water utility bills.
The entire objective of this project was to follow proper OOP principles for clean and professional code, thus the focus on purely backend.

This project shows:
>Use of interface with proper terminology for calculating the electricity/water bill
>Proper function modularity
>Use of inheritance via a single Rate class
>Proper data hiding techniques via getters/setters
>Problem solving via the use of DecimalFormat class for cleaner outputs
>Use of Polymorphism via overriding
>Use of abstraction via interface
>Proper validation
>Proper Encapsulation


Any helpful feedback is always welcome.
